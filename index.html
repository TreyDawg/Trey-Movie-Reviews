    <h1>Trey's Movie Reviews</h1>
    <p>Hi I'm Trey Gewecke & I'm going to be reviewing a couple movies in this page.  Today I will get started by reviewing "The Mummy" franchise the Brendan Fraser trilogy and the spinoff "The Scorpion King" will be adressed on here(I'm aware that there are more Scorpion King movies that were straight to DVD but I'm only reviewing theatricly released movies).  This review will be spoiler free.  So I hope all of you enjoy.</p>
      
    <h2>The Mummy Trilogy</h2>

    <h4>Pros</h4>
    <ul>It's fun time for history buffs</ul>
    <ul>A new and fun take on a old story</ul>
    <ul>The first movie blended horror, action, and comedy so well</ul>
    <ul>The mythology behind the mummy and why he was punished</ul>
    <ul>Brendan Fraser is very good at portraying the likable every-man type hero</ul>
    <ul>John Hannah is good as the funny guy</ul>
    <ul>The set pieces are historicly accurate</ul>
    <ul>Good humor</ul>
    <ul>Well done flashback sequences</ul>
    <ul>Action is well done for the most part</ul>
    <ul>Well done camera work in the first 2 movies</ul>
    <ul>The group of good guys are well portrayed</ul>
    <ul>Good green screen and CGI effects for surrounding features</ul>
    <h4>Cons</h4>
    <ul>A huge cheese factor in all the final showdowns</ul>
    <ul>A wierd opening naration</ul>
    <ul>THE WHOLE 3RD MOVIE</ul>  
    <ul>A iffy preformance from Arnold Vosloo and Patricia Velasquez</ul>
    <ul>Bad CGI on characters and other important stuff to th plot</ul>
    <ul>Annoying and at times poorly writen characters</ul>
    <ul>In the 3rd movie there was too much use of shaky cam</ul>
    <ul>Some moments where you can't contemplate what is going on</ul>
    <ul>Stiff acting from almost everyone the whole 3rd movie</ul>
    <ul>The 3rd movie had almost nothing to do with the 1st two</ul>
    <p>Overall I really like this trilogy well except the third movie so what I'll do is grade the first 2 movies together and the 3rd movie seperatley</p>
    <h5>I will give the first 2 movies a B-</h5>
    <h5>As for the 3rd movie I'll give it a D+</h5>
    <h5>The type of people who will enjoy this.  This movie if you look at this closley it is obviously made for histoy buffs and I was at one time studying history so this was basiclly made for me and they  did a good job for the most part.</h5>
    <h2>The Spin-off Movie</h2>
    <h3>The Scorpion King</h3>

    <h4>Pros</h4>
    <ul>The Rock is pretty good and brings a certain charisma to this movie</ul>
    <ul>The late Michael Clarke Duncan is very good in this movie making everything he touches into gold</ul>  
    <ul>The set pieces in this are very good as is the practical effects</ul>
    <ul>At times good action</ul>
    <h4>Cons</h4>
    <ul>Very very over the top in almost every way possible for a film</ul>
    <ul>This movie looked more like a Old Spice & Baby Oil commercial with a bunch of buff dudes and hot chicks</ul>
    <ul>So much over acting</ul>
    <ul>Some wierd naration in the beginning</ul>
    <ul>a lot very annoying, poorly portrayed, and or poorly written characters</ul>
    <ul>Very ridiculous lines of dialogue</ul>
    <ul>Very poor green screen and CGI</ul>
    <ul>Pure ridiculousness with the action most of the movie</ul>
    <ul>Very very poor acting at times</ul>
    <ul>This movie looked like a big giant commercial for the WWE's next fight</ul>
    <h5>Over all this movie is bad but definitley not as bad as the 3rd Mummy movie that being said I'll have to give it a C</h5>
    <h5>I think this movie was made for WWE fans</h5>
