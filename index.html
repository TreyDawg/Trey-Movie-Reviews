    <h1>Trey's Movie Reviews</h1>
    <p>Hi I'm Trey Gewecke & I'm going to be reviewing a couple movies in this page.  Today I will get started by reviewing "The Mummy" franchise the Brendan Fraser trilogy and the spinoff "The Scorpion King" will be adressed on here.  There will be a slight spoiler that will be tied into the trilogy, but not the "The Scorpion King" that will be spoiler free.  So I hope all of you enjoy.</p>
      
    <h2>The Mummy Trilogy</h2>
    <h3>The Mummy</h3>
    <p>"The Mummy" is directed by Steven Sommers & stars Brendan Fraser.  This is a remake of a movie originally done in 1932.  This movie was a moderate success with a total box office gross of $152 million.</p>
    <h3>The Mummy Returns</h3>
    <p>"The Mummy Returns" like the first movie returns Steven Sommers as director & Brendan Fraser as the star.  This is also Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's first movie where he plays The Scorpion King.  This was a even bigger success than the 1st movie making $433</p>
    <h3>The Mummy: Tomb of The Dragon Emporor</h3>
