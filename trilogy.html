    <p>"The Mummy" is directed by Steven Sommers & stars Brendan Fraser.  This is a remake of a movie originally released 1932 and was released in 1999.  This movie was a big success with a total box office gross of $415 million.</p>
    <h3>The Mummy Returns</h3>

    <p>"The Mummy Returns" like the first movie returns Steven Sommers as director & Brendan Fraser as the star.  This is also Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's first movie where he plays The Scorpion King.  This was a even bigger success than the 1st movie making $433</p>
    <h3>The Mummy: Tomb of The Dragon Emporor</h3>
    <iframe width="200" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5-4qSE2Ch0Y" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>"The Mummy: Tomb of The Dragon Emporor" unlike the first 2 movies is directed by Rob Cohen not Steven Sommers although he did return as a prducer.  The only 2 actors who decided to return for this movie from the first 2 movies is Brendan Fraser and John Hannah.  One thing I thought was interesting was Jet Li is the villain.  This movie was also a huge success making $401 million.</p>
 <h3>The Scorpion King</h3>
    <iframe width="200" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CmEKTae2iys" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <p>"The Scorpion King" is directed by Chuck Russell & stars Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson in his first lead role.  This was released in 2002 right off the success of "The Mummy Returns".  This is produced by Vince McMann and the WWE so that was a huge marketing tool like The Rock being in "The Mummy Returns".  This was another success making $165 million worldwide</p>
